#! This file define a schema for all ytt data files. It can also contain default values.
#! Top-level keys are scopes, e.g. application, argocd, environment, helm.
#!
#! Content of the `application` scope can be freely modified. More scopes can be added.
#!
#! All other scopes and their keys defined in this file are used by myks.
#! Values of these keys can be modified, but the keys should not be removed.
#! It is fine, however, to add new keys to these scopes.
